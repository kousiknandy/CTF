The given challenge is a large innocent looking number hiding the flag
in it. We can apply multiple transformations on this, e.g xor with next
digit, do some popular encoding, but the biggest giveaway the preceeding
text, where a cat seems to greet you. People familiar with pop culture
(or a google search will do) will refer to the zero wing game's meme,
and we immediately guess that we are talking about 'bases'. 

So we convert the number to various bases and see which is promising
(for symbols, we take 0-9, a-z and follow ASCII order):

10 322145362233401483623797406212442570811157273117325550441636938298904

Finally at base 39, the pattern seems promising - it contains what
we're searching for ... a "flag{". But we need to recover the rest.
This is where the second note is helpful, which says 0 or 1 can be
either one. So we construct the number with all possible combination
and check the output. The following snippet of code can be helpful:

t = "322{}453622334{}{}4836237974{}62{}244257{}8{}{}{}57273{}{}732555{}44{}6369382989{}4"
for i in range(16384): 
    b1 = "{0:014b}".format(i)
    n = int(t.format(*b1))
    # now print n in base 39

However we still have 16000+ potential flags to deal with, how
should we narrow it down to the actual flag? Again we note that
the number is part of dialog (again a google search will reveal):

 Captain: It's you!!
 CATS: How are you gentlemen!!
 CATS: All your base are belong to us.    <-----------
 CATS: You are on the way to destruction.

So, with the spirit of the dialog, the flag has to relate to the
next, perhaps the most famous, sentence. We grep for words from
the outputs, taking care of l337 conversions. For example filtering
via `grep "flag{.*}" | grep base` brings us down to 81 choices, and
further filtering `grep "flag{.*}" | grep base | grep us` brings us
to two:

1992flag{catsa||y0urbasearebe10ngt0us}0wings
1992flag{catsa||y0urbasearebe10ngt0us}0wing}

From here the flag is easy to guess: catsa||y0urbasearebe10ngt0us
which is a paraphrase of the dialog continued.
